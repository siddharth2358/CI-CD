CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub to Jenkins Integration
This repository is configured with an automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. A push to this repository will automatically trigger a build on our Jenkins server.

This README.md file explains the setup for this integration.

1. Jenkins Job Configuration
The Jenkins job is configured to use a Pipeline script from SCM, which means the entire build process is defined in a Jenkinsfile stored in this repository.

Source Code Management: The job is set up to pull code from this GitHub repository using the Git plugin.

Credentials: A Personal Access Token (PAT) is used to authenticate Jenkins with GitHub, allowing it to clone the private repository.

Build Trigger: The Jenkinsfile itself contains a githubPush() trigger, which tells Jenkins to listen for a webhook notification from GitHub whenever a commit is pushed.

2. GitHub Webhook Setup
A webhook is configured in the repository's settings to notify Jenkins of any code changes.

Payload URL: The webhook's payload URL points to our Jenkins server's GitHub webhook endpoint. For local development, we used a tunneling service like Localtunnel to expose our local Jenkins server to the public internet.


Content Type: The content type is set to application/json, which is the standard format for GitHub webhooks.

Events: The webhook is configured to trigger on push events, ensuring that any new commit automatically initiates a build.

3. The Jenkinsfile
The Jenkinsfile in this repository defines the build pipeline as code. It includes stages for checking out the code, and building the project.

Groovy

pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        // Triggers a build when a change is pushed to the repository
        githubPush()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                echo 'Checking out code...'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building project...'
            }
        }
    }
}
How It Works
A developer makes a change and pushes a commit to the main branch.

GitHub detects the push event and sends a webhook payload to the Jenkins server's public URL.

Jenkins receives the payload and, because of the githubPush() trigger in the Jenkinsfile, it starts a new build job.

Jenkins executes the pipeline steps defined in the Jenkinsfile, ensuring the latest code is built and verified automatically.
